# Hillary Clinton is meh but I'm Voting for Her Anyway (dot com)
## Doing the Needful in 2016

### About

This is a repository of short political arguments in favor of Hillary Clinton. They are meant to appeal to people who are disaffected with her as a candidate, but who are probably aligned with some of her policies.

In short order I'll be turning this into a microsite with it's own domain. I need help right now filling in the "blank" in the name, as well as with ideas and editorial support. See below for context.

### History

I [worked professionally](http://blogs.harvard.edu/lydondev/2003/12/04/music-for-america-sountrack-of-the-transformation/) on the 2004 presidential cycle in one of the first overt efforts to organize and turn out millennial voters. Perhaps I'm falling victim to the human tendency to relive one's glory days, but it seems that the dynamics of that race presented challenges that are reminiscent of today.

Circa 2004 George W Bush was still broadly popular, but to younger voters he presented much to organize "against", from his initiation of war in Iraq to his alliance with regressive anti-equality social forces. The stakes seemed very high. However, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, was problematic. A compromising, uncharismatic, centrist career politician with a cerebral style and deep establishment roots, his campaign struggled to create a digestible message capable of energizing the electorate, and had difficulty fending off negative attacks and narratives from both the right and the left.

Around this point in that cycle, a website appeared with a series of short essays which I personally found very helpful. They frankly acknowledged the shortcomings of Kerry as a candidate while underlining the importance of pulling the lever for him nevertheless. The website was called "[John Kerry is a Douchebag but I'm Voting for Him Anyway](https://web.archive.org/web/20040723070151/http://www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com/)."

In that same spirit, I want to make a pragmatic case for voting Clinton, even though she's a flawed candidate. This repository will be where I construct the arguments, and the domain we'll publish under will be "Hillary Clinton is a _______ but I'm Voting for Her Anyway." 

Pull requests are welcome.
