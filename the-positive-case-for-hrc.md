# How I Overcame My Reluctance To Voting Clinton

I am not drawn to Hillary Clinton as a candidate. I didn't support her in 2008, and I didn't cast my primary vote for her this year either. However, I've overcome my reservations about her and will be voting for her in November. In this short essay, I'll explain my thinking, starting with how I found peace with my negative feelings, and then some reasons to be optimistic about President Clinton.

## Reasons for Depression and How I Got Past Them

### Her Hawkish Foreign Policy

The most significant reservation I have about Hillary Clinton is [her hawkish military instincts](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/how-hillary-clinton-became-a-hawk.html?_r=0). Beginning with her vote for the war in Iraq, proceeding through the way she campaigned in 2008, and continuing during her tenure as Secretary of State, she's exhibited a comfortability with unleashing violence, a belief in American hegemony, and a skepticism towards peacemaking and international cooperation. I'm not down with that.

Putting it in the harshest terms, her political legacy includes getting a lot of people killed, and she seems to see this as a selling point. She is proud to be buddies with Henry Kissinger for crying out loud. 

However, politics is not about purity, and a vote is not a moral endorsement. This is important to keep in mind. Voting is hardly a rational process. It's personal and private, but your vote is also not your identity.

Elections are fundamentally processes for choosing, and when it comes to choosing a President probably the single most important aspect is how they'll command the military. I am not optimistic about her foreign policy, but given our choices in this election Hillary is clearly the person I prefer to be in charge for the next four years. It's not really a contest.

### Neoliberal on Trade & Economic Inequality

This is the other huge policy issue I have with Clinton: she's a textbook neoliberal when it comes to trade and finance. She's championed every "free trade" deal that's come along (including the TPP until recently), and been an active participant the transformation which over the past 30-odd years has led to record inequality and the greatest economic crisis in generations.

Now, I actually don't believe for a second that she's "owned" by the big banks, or is anyone's puppet. But I do belive that she's ideologically aligned with them, largely sharing their worldview. This is why she can pull down big paychecks speaking to Wall Street firms. It's not a stretch for her to go into that kind of venue and give a positive talk. Basically she sees them as her peers.

However, when it comes to her specific economic proposals, they're actually pretty good, if a bit on the incremental side. She aims to raise the minimum wage, decrease student debt, end the shame of the US being the only industrialized country which doesn't mandate paid maternal leave. These are inarguably decent things to do, and they'd be real achievements.

In many ways she's not really all that different from Obama when it comes to the economy. While her instincts lean towards continuing the continued empowerment of a global elite (of which her family is a part), she's also demonstrated herself as being responsive to political pressure on economic policy. Her positions have grown in stature and scope as a result of the primary process.

To close out on this point, I also feel a need to stick up for the general ideas of globalism and trade. While we've been doing a poor job of managing globalization, I also don't believe there's really a real way to "go back" on the process, nor would I want to. The future is not in national isolation; it's in figuring out a more broadly prosperous and humane way to integrate the world.

### She's a Pandering Career Politician

It's natural and even laudable for a politician to change their position when new evidence comes to light, or if over the long haul they simply change their mind. However, many of Hillary's reversals over her career seem to be conspicuously associated with political expediency, as opposed to finding new information or having a legitimate change of heart. 

This is frustrating, because it doesn't give one much of a sense of what she truly believes. However, as I alluded to above, this is also something of an opportunity. It demonstrates that Clinton is sensitive to political pressure and popular opinion around the issues.

When you say it like that, it's kind of par for the course. While you don't want a leader whose whole agenda is poll-driven, being responsive to public sentiment is a de-facto part of the job. 

My sense is that while she won't push the envelope for progress, she will go as far as she feels it's safe, and hold any ground that's gained. For instance, she was never a champion for marriage equality, but once there was some momentum there she was on board. Likewise, while she might be naturally inclined towards a hawkishly neoliberal outlook, she can be deterred by political reality (e.g. her about-face on the TPP).

### Bad at Campaigning

Hillary Clinton is by her own admission not a great campaigner. She's not a very good public speaker, which is hard not to notice compared to the incumbent Obama, or her primary opponent Bernie Sanders. 

A stark example of weakness was during the primary debates whenever they got to [the closing remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpTSYFf2YRQ). Sanders would give a rehearsed but personable homily, starting with his growing up poor, pivoting to the issue of inequality, and finally expressing the mission of his campaign with eloquent human language. In response, Clinton would basically run through a checklist that often came out as word salad. To me it was cringy, and the different audience responses seem to suggest I'm not the only one.

As someone who spent their early career practicing law, and their mid-life to late adulthood under harsh and adversarial scruitiny, Hillary Clinton is highly guarded and deliberate in what she says. She's risk-averse. She sticks to the script. The script is written from within her campaign's bubble and sometimes isn't super great. And again, she's not a natural orator. 

Similar to her shifting positions, I think this is actually to be expected  from a politicians. It's more annoying than a reason to oppose her, but I list it here because if I'm being honest, it contributes to my sense of depression. Ideally I want a candidate who inspires me, which she has so far failed to do.

That said, I do think that we're not used to seeing this relatively common combination of traits — some opportunitic shifts in position, a talking-points communication style — show up in female form, which might explain some of why this sticks out so much. This is "typical politician" stuff, which isn't super awesome, but feels like it should be easier to get past than it seems to be.

But when you do get past it, this weakness is in it's own way a call to action. Let's be honest, Clinton's candidacy needs help, and what it needs help with the most is communication. There's a natural place for you to fit in and help out by making the case for Hillary in your own language to your own people. You'll probably do a better job than she will, and the world will thank you for your service.

# Reasons To Actually Get Excited

I framed this piece the way I did because I am trying to appeal to people who (like me) start off as less than energized about voting for Clinton. Maybe you feel like it's like a duty, a reluctant chore. A "hold your nose and vote" moment. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I am asking you to consider that there are legitimate reasons to be enthusiastic about the potential for President HRC.

## The Good Stuff

### Smash Patriarchy

We should honestly be excited about this campaign for the same national identity reasons we were excited about Obama. There's nothing wrong with being proud about voting for our first female president. It's one of the most simple and pure reasons to be positive and happy about this campaign. It's a real thing! Enjoy it!

It will also be a huge fight. Clinton's candidacy will unleash public debate about sexism and the role of women that could well be more fraught than what came out of Obama's term in office, and no less vital. The microagressions of the primaries pale in comparison to the vitrol this is drawing from the GOP. I believe it is positive to pull this venom to the surface so it can be directly and publicly rejected.

I've got a daughter now, and I believe it will make a real difference in how she sees the world if she grows up knowing that a woman can lead this country. Maybe this matters to you, and even if not I'm sure you have sisters, neices, cousins, and friends for whom it will mean a lot. 

### Pack the Court

If you are any kind of political nerd, you know the next four years will be hugely consequential for the Supreme Court. There's one vacancy to replace arch-conservative Antonin Scalia, and likely openings from liberal icon Ruth "The Notorious RBG" Bader Ginsburg and possibly "swing vote" Anthony Kennedy, both of whom are over 80 years old. There are also rumors on the internets that Clarance Thomas would like to retire relatively early.

President Clinton's legacy could be a progressive Supreme Court that lasts through the next several administrations. From a brass tacks policy standpoint, this is the single biggest win on the table. A Clinton court would have positive implications for a wide array of issues, both in terms of allowing a progressive agenda to proceed, and also acting as a backstop when the pendulum inevitably swings back the other way. 

It's hard to understate how much of a difference this could make, especially considering that virtually any significant achievement in law over the next 30 years will almost certainly recieve the same kind of desperate legal challenges as the Affordable Care Act did. Locking up the Supreme Court would be a generational-level win for progress. 

### Someone We Can Push

Realistically, the change we all want to see won't come by electing a single person to a single office. Presidential elections are huge, sweeping events — the main event in US Politics — but we all know it takes a lot more than a President to make change happen. At a minimum you have to have a Congress that will approve funds and legislate your agenda, and to get that you need a large ongoing effort by citizens to counteract the ever present influence of the status-quo and special interests.

While Clinton is frankly a mostly status-quo candidate herself, as I've mentioned above she is responsive to political pressure, including pressure from the left. This means that for anyone on board with the long-term effort to make the country (and the world) a better place, her election represents an opportunity. 

Continued orginization and activism during her term in office should be able to get better policies enacted. Moreover, a Clinton presidency would be an chance to "move the Overton window," shifting the bounds of what's seen as thinkable or doable by establishment types, another generational victory.

Clearly we can't just elect her and expect her to take care of business, but the truth is that is never going to happen no matter who occupies the oval office, a mistake I think a lot of people made with Obama. Change takes a lot of people getting involved and staying involved (meaning they do so sustainably) not just to elect leaders, but to to create public momentum and leverage to pressure them to action once in office.

### She Knows How To Fight

Speaking of Obama, my biggest disappointment with him is that he squandered his own window of opportunity, the congressional majority during the first two years of his term. That was the time to unabashedly push his agenda, but instead he reached out for a grand bargan or compromise with the then-minority GOP. 

That didn't go well, and he was subsequently burned multiple times trying to "negotiate" with GOP congressional and senate leaders who were pretty clearly acting in bad faith. It wasn't really until he was into his second term that Obama stopped looking for a fantasy bi-partisan consensus, but by then it was far too late.

Hillary Clinton has had the GOP attempting to destroy her for almost a quarter centiry. She has no illusions about who her opposition will be and how they operate, and if she wins they will throw the kitchen sink at her. 

### A Positive Scenario: Overturning Citizens United

My positive vision is not one of what Clinton can do for us, but more about what could be accomplished by using her presidency as a vehicle for change and organization.

A Clinton presidency presents opportunity for progress, and not just for the reasons I've outlined above. While her campaign itself is a moderate center-left affair, I don't think it's unreasonable to envision a Clinton presidency providing the conditions for more meaningful longer-term changes to begin.

The neoliberal consensus which she symbolizes is in the process of unraveling, just as the GOP's core coalition is coming apart. We're likely to see a lot of reorganization of our politics over the next few cycles as  baby boomers begin to age out of leadership roles. Having the next four years (or more) be charactarized by advancing an agenda and building a movement which is able to achieve results will provide fertile ground for a next generation to emerge.

It's a lot better to be playing offense.

The best case scenario for this fall is that not only does Clinton prevail, but that she does so as part of an elevated level of turnout which reverses control of the Senate, and narrows the GOP House majority. This would likely lead to a breakdown of organized and disciplined opposition, and create a window of opportunity to advance broadly popular legislation.

One of Clinton's more exciting campaign promises is to introduce a consitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. This is vital if we want to reduce the political influence of corporations and the hyper-wealthy, but passing a constitutional amendment requires a nationwide referrendum in which two 38 out of 50 states must ratify the change. That means we'll need a serious 50-state strategy once again.

This kind of operation will not be driven by a President, or even by the Democratic party. It will have to be a broader people powered coalition, providing a golden opportunity for a "do over" on 2008: the ability to put a candidate over the top, and to continue organizing to keep that candidate (and others) motivated do fulfill her mandate, while also achieving wins at the state and local level.

This is the kind of organization which could grow in strength through a period of political realignment, maturing into a meaningful and enduring vehicle for positive change.

Now, is it the most likely outcome of electing Hillary Clinton? No. But it's a lot more realistic than thinking we can blow it all up and start over, or that protest alone can deliver real change. It will take a lot of work and probably some luck, but ultimately we must realize that the positive potential democracy doesn't begin and end at the ballot box, and practice the art of controlling our environment.

President Clinton will provide much better future conditions for improving the world than the alternative. On that basis, any progressive should be able to cast her or his vote for Hillary with a clean conscience.
