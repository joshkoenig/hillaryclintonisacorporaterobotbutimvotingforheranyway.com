# How I Overcame My Reluctance To Voting Clinton

I am not drawn to Hillary Clinton as a candidate. I didn't support her in 2008, and I didn't cast my primary vote for her this year either. However, I've overcome my reservations about her and will be voting for her in November. In this short essay, I'll explain my thinking, starting with how I found peace with my negative feelings, and then some reasons to be optimistic about President Clinton.

## Part 1 - Reasons for Depression and How I Got Past Them

### Her Hawkish Foreign Policy

The most significant problem I have with Hillary Clinton is [her hawkish military instincts](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/how-hillary-clinton-became-a-hawk.html?_r=0). Beginning with her vote for the war in Iraq, proceeding through the way she campaigned in 2008, and continuing during her tenure as Secretary of State, she's exhibited a comfortability with unleashing violence, a belief in American hegemony, and a skepticism towards peacemaking and international cooperation. I'm not down with that.

Putting it in the harshest terms, her political legacy includes getting a lot of people killed, and she seems to see this as a selling point. She is proud to be buddies with Henry Kissinger for crying out loud. 

However, politics is not about purity, and a vote is not a moral endorsement. This is important to keep in mind. Voting is hardly a rational process. It's personal and private, but your vote is also not your identity.

Elections are fundamentally processes for choosing, and when it comes to choosing a President probably the single most important aspect is how they'll command the military. I am not optimistic about her foreign policy, but given our choices in this election Hillary is clearly the person I prefer to be in charge for the next four years. It's not really a contest.

### Neoliberal on Trade & Economic Inequality

This is the other huge policy issue I have with Clinton: she's a textbook neoliberal when it comes to trade and finance. She's championed every "free trade" deal that's come along (including the TPP until recently), and been an active participant the transformation which over the past 30-odd years has led to record inequality and the greatest economic crisis in generations.

Now, I actually don't believe for a second that she's "owned" by the big banks, or is anyone's puppet. But I do belive that she's ideologically aligned with them, largely sharing their worldview. This is why she can pull down big paychecks speaking to Wall Street firms. It's not a stretch for her to go into that kind of venue and give a positive talk. Basically she sees them as her peers.

However, when it comes to her specific economic proposals, they're actually pretty good, if a bit on the incremental side. She aims to raise the minimum wage, decrease student debt, end the shame of the US being the only industrialized country which doesn't mandate paid maternal leave. These are inarguably decent things to do, and they'd be real achievements.

In many ways she's not really all that different from Obama when it comes to the economy. While her instincts lean towards continuing the continued empowerment of a global elite (of which her family is a part), she's also demonstrated herself as being responsive to political pressure on economic policy. Her positions have grown in stature and scope as a result of the primary process.

To close out on this point, I also feel a need to stick up for the general ideas of globalism and trade. While we've been doing a poor job of managing globalization, I also don't believe there's really a real way to "go back" on the process, nor would I want to. The future is not in national isolation; it's in figuring out a more broadly prosperous and humane way to integrate the world.

### She's a Pandering Career Politician

It's natural and even laudable for a politician to change their position when new evidence comes to light, or if over the long haul they simply change their mind. However, many of Hillary's reversals over her career seem to be conspicuously associated with political expediency, as opposed to finding new information or having a legitimate change of heart. 

This is frustrating, because it doesn't give one much of a sense of what she truly believes. However, as I alluded to above, this is also something of an opportunity. It demonstrates that Clinton is sensitive to political pressure and popular opinion around the issues.

When you say it like that, it's kind of par for the course. While you don't want a leader whose whole agenda is poll-driven, being responsive to public sentiment is a de-facto part of the job. 

My sense is that while she won't push the envelope for progress, she will go as far as she feels it's safe, and hold any ground that's gained. For instance, she was never a champion for marriage equality, but once there was some momentum there she was on board. Likewise, while she might be naturally inclined towards a hawkishly neoliberal outlook, she can be deterred by political reality (e.g. her about-face on the TPP).

### Bad at Campaigning

Hillary Clinton is by her own admission not a great campaigner. She's not a very good public speaker, which is hard not to notice compared to the incumbent Obama, or her primary opponent Bernie Sanders. 

A stark example of weakness was during the primary debates whenever they got to [the closing remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpTSYFf2YRQ). Sanders would give a rehearsed but personable homily, starting with his growing up poor, pivoting to the issue of inequality, and finally expressing the mission of his campaign with eloquent human language. In response, Clinton would basically run through a checklist that often came out as word salad. To me it was cringy, and the different audience responses seem to suggest I'm not the only one.

As someone who spent their early career practicing law, and their mid-life to late adulthood under harsh and adversarial scruitiny, Hillary Clinton is highly guarded and deliberate in what she says. She's risk-averse. She sticks to the script. The script is written from within her campaign's bubble and sometimes isn't super great. And again, she's not a natural orator. 

Similar to her shifting positions, I think this is actually to be expected  from a politicians. It's more annoying than a reason to oppose her, but I list it here because if I'm being honest, it contributes to my sense of depression. Ideally I want a candidate who inspires me, which she has so far failed to do.

That said, I do think that we're not used to seeing this relatively common combination of traits — some opportunitic shifts in position, a talking-points communication style — show up in female form, which might explain some of why this sticks out so much. This is "typical politician" stuff, which isn't super awesome, but feels like it should be easier to get past than it seems to be.

But when you do get past it, this weakness is in it's own way a call to action. Let's be honest, Clinton's candidacy needs help, and what it needs help with the most is communication. There's a natural place for you to fit in and help out by making the case for Hillary in your own language to your own people. You'll probably do a better job than she will, and the world will thank you for your service.

## Part 2 - The Good Stuff

(This part is still a work in progress.)

### A Wound to the Patriarchy

We should honestly be excited about this for the same reasons we were excited about Obama. There's nothing wrong with being proud about the win of having the first female president. I've got a daughter now, and I believe this will make a real difference in how she sees the world.

Also, microagressions in the primaries pale in comparison to the vitrol this is drawing from the GOP. I think it will ultimately be positive to pull this to the surface.

### Pack the Court

"I don't know about you, but I'm voting for a three decade liberal majority on the Supreme Court this November."

### Someone We Can Push

All of the above about her being malleable, and the necessity of not getting super focused on the singular office of the president. If we want good things to happen, we have to stay organized and keep pushing. Hillary is the pushable candidate.

### She Knows How To Fight

Obama pissed away his window of opportunity looking for a grand bargan or compromise with the then-minority GOP. I don't believe Clinton will make similar mistakes. 

### The Dream Scenario

If Clinton wins big, and the election manages to flip the senate and bring the house closer, the GOP could well descend further into internal infighting. There will be an opportunity to get some real governing done, while the Republican party goes through a long overdue reboot.
